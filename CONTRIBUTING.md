## <a name="commit-messages"></a> Commit Messages

Treat commit messages as an email message that describes what you changed and why.

The first line of the commit log should be treated as as an email
subject line.  It must be strictly no greater than 50 characters long.
The subject should stand on its own and not mearly make external
references, such as to relevant bug numbers or a URL.

When committing from the command line, the second line must be blank.

The third line begins the body of the commit message (one or more
paragraphs) describing the details of the commit.  Paragraphs are each
separated by a blank line.  Paragraphs must be word wrapped to be no
longer than 76 characters.

The last part of the commit log should contain all "external
references", such as which issues were fixed or URLs to external content.

## Submitting a Pull Request

We accept changes as Pull Requests. The [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
guidelines around this are pretty good, please review them first.

Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/unitedstates/acronym/pulls) for an open or closed Pull Request that 
 relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
* [Fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) using the default branch, which is wh-pages.
GitHub might do this for you automatically if you start to edit a file in the browser, and give you a message
like "You’re editing a file in a project you don’t have write access to. Submitting a change will change the 
file in a new branch in your fork usrename/acronym, so you can send a pull request."
* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our
  [commit message conventions](#commit-messages)
* Send a pull request. By default the pull request message will be the commit message you just wrote.
* Owners of this repo will review the pull request. We may suggest changes or accept the request as is.
* After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository.
